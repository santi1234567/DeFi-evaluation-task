# Aave V2 Wrapper Contract

This project consists of the development of a wrapper contract for the [Aave V2 lending pool](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/). It was built as an InstaDapp Evaluation task. The assignment can be found in [Evaluation-Task.pdf](https://github.com/santi1234567/Instadapp-evaluation-task/blob/main/Evaluation-Task.pdf).

For testing, a mainnet fork is used. The provider is Infura.
